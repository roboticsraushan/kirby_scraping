Hi {name},

A quick update from our side, and all of this has happened just in the last few weeks: 

• Company is officially incorporated 
• We've finalized a live+work villa setup in Bangalore, [work-eat-sleep-repeat]
• Team's in motion: 4 interns onboarded, 2 full-time engineers joining soon
• Procurement for key hardware is underway
• MVP will be ready in 2 months[week-wise dev plan ready with contingency], and we kick off our first real-world pilot in Month 3 (in Bangalore), in a banglore it company washroom 

We're raising a ₹1.5–2 Cr angel round, got some commitment already, with ₹20L as minimum cheque size.

Would deeply appreciate if you could connect us with any angels who can bring patient capital to back a deeptech startup from India, for the world.

Will send over our updated vision slide + demo videos right after this — feel free to forward them!

Thanks a lot for your continued support 🙏
